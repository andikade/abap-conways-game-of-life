# abap-conways-game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life (written in ABAP)

The idea for this repository was born at the ABAP Code Retreat @ Schwarz IT Infrastructure & Operations Services 
about test-driven development (TDD) on July 22, 2017.

This project is not about functionality, but about gaining experience with TDD (and achieving the highest possible test coverage ;)).
